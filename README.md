A historical dataset from previous loan applications is taking, cleaning of the data, and applying different classification algorithm on the data is done. Following algorithms are used to build your models:
k-Nearest Neighbour
Decision Tree
Support Vector Machine
Logistic Regression

The results is reported as the accuracy of each classifier, using the following metrics when these are applicable:
Jaccard index
F1-score
LogLoass
